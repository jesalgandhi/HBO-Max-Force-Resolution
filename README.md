# HBO Now â€¢ Force Resolution
Brings the ability to manually choose resolutions on the HBO Now player. You can force whatever resolution you want, whether it's 1080p or 360p.

Without this extension, the viewing experience was erratic and unseemly. No more fuzzy pictures or sudden drops in quality.
